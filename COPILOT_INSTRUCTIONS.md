# GitHub Copilot Usage Instructions

## Purpose
This document provides guidelines for using GitHub Copilot in the BoomBeasts project to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Instructions
- Always accept Copilot suggestions that follow the formatting rules defined in `.prettierrc`.
- If Copilot suggests code that does not match the project's style, reformat it before committing.
- Use the `npm run format` command to auto-format Copilot-generated code before each commit.
- Review Copilot suggestions for logic errors, security issues, and project-specific conventions.
- Do not commit code that fails Prettier or lint checks.

## Recommended Editor Settings
- Install the Prettier extension for your editor and enable format-on-save.
- Enable Copilot only in files where it is helpful and review all suggestions carefully.
